    * Location: Deploy on Detection Server
    * How to use: launch rest_ocsvm_gt.py 
    * Notes: REST API is running on Flask.

* <a href="https://github.com/sisoc-tokyo/Real-timeDetectionAD/tree/master/logstash">Configuration files for Logstash</a>
    * Files
        * logstash_winlogbeat.conf: Configuration file of Logstash. Logs are sent through the pipline of Logstash. Logstash extract data for detection from logs and call the REST API "rest_ocsvm_gt.py".<br/>
        This file should be located in Log Server where Logstash is running. 
    * Location: Deploy on Log Server
    * How to use: 
        * Launch Logstash by specifing the conf file.<br/>
	    e.g.）logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash_winlogbeat.conf &<br/>

* <a href="https://github.com/sisoc-tokyo/Real-timeDetectionAD/tree/master/winlogbeat">Configuration files for Winlogbeat</a>
    * Files
        * winlogbeat.yml: Configuration file of Winlogbeat. This file should be located in Domain Controller where Winlogbeat is running. 
    * Location: Place in the install directory of Winlogbeat on Domain Controller
    * How to use: 
	    * Star Winlogbeat on Domain Controller
 
* <a href="https://github.com/sisoc-tokyo/Real-timeDetectionAD/tree/master/learningTools">Learning tools</a>
    * Files
        * ADLogParserForML: Java programs to prepare for creating input for Goldenticket_One-class_SVM.ipynb. This programs extract data from Event Logs exported as CSV files.<br/>
        We tested this program on Java 1.8 .
        * Goldenticket_One-class_SVM.ipynb : A Python program runnung on the Jupyter Notebook to create model and calculate detection rate.
    * Location: Deploy on Detection Server
    * How to use: 
        1. Export Domain Controller Event logs as CSV file format using built-in Windows function (Rigiht click Event Logs and save as csv file).
        
        2. Execute ADLogParserForML using the above Event Logs as inputs. Then parsed csv file (eventlog.csv) will be created.<br/>
        <pre>
        # cd ADLogParserForML/bin
        # java logparse/AuthLogParser /Users/Documents/tmp/input /Users/marikof/Documents/tmp/output  /Users/Documents/tmp/input/command.txt /Users/marikof/Documents/tmp/input/adminlist.txt
        </pre>
        
        3. Execute Goldenticket_One-class_SVM_create_model.ipynb.<br/>
        You will get model files (ocsvm_gt_XXXX.pkl) and One-Hot encoding dummy files (data_dummies_XXXX.csv). Please move or copy these file to "detectionTools" directory.
        
        4. If you want to see detection result, please check X_train_result4674.csv and X_train_result4688.csv files.The rightmost column shows result, "1" means normal and "-1" means outlier.
        
        
     * (Optional) If you want to evaluate with logs generated by attack, please refer below to create dataset. However created model files don't work, they are used for just check the result.:      
        1. Export Domain Controller Event logs as CSV file format using built-in Windows function (Rigiht click Event Logs and save as csv file).
        
        2. Execute ADLogParserForML using the above Event Logs as inputs. Then parsed csv file (eventlog.csv) will be created.<br/>
        <pre>
        # cd ADLogParserForML/bin
        # java logparse/AuthLogParser /Users/Documents/tmp/input /Users/marikof/Documents/tmp/output  /Users/Documents/tmp/input/command.txt /Users/marikof/Documents/tmp/input/adminlist.txt
        </pre>
          
        3. Open eventlog.csv and organize the value of "target" column as follows.
            * train
            * test
            * outlier
                        
            "train" data is training data and should be in normal states. Machine learning learns these data.<br/>
            "test" data means normal data. Machine lerning doe's not learn these data, they are used only for evaluation. Please change some target value from "train" to "test".<br/>
            "outlier" data means outlier data. Machine lerning doe's not learn these data, they are used only for evaluation. Please set target value "outlier" for logs of attack behavior.<br/>
                      
        4. Execute One-class_SVM.ipynb. You should specify the file path of eventlog.csv. <br/>
            You will get model files (ocsvm_gt_XXXX.pkl) and One-Hot encoding dummy files (data_dummies_XXXX.csv).
            
        5. If you want to see detection result, please check X_outliers_resultXXXX.csv, X_test_resultXXXX.csv and X_ourlier_resultXXXX.csv files.The rightmost column shows result, "1" means normal and "-1" means outlier.
